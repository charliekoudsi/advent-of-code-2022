# My Brainfuck Solution

A few notes:

1. My solution only solves part 1. I had minimal time to work on this (and this was my first experience with the language), so part 1 was all I could complete.
2. My solution requires the use of 16 bit (or larger) cells. I often make use of numbers larger than 255, so 8 bit just won't cut it. This means that "try it online" will not work for running it (but [copy.sh](http://copy.sh/brainfuck) will).
3. Input must be 1000 lines with a trailing new line character. While the choice of 1000 was made to be able to test against the provided input, any 1000 line input will work (technically 1001 lines including trailing new line).
